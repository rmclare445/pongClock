# pongClock
 Arduino clock on ping pong ball matrix

Sorry there's no real documentation here.  I hope to get to it eventually but since this project was so hardware-intensive, even somewhat explaining the system will necessarily involve figures and math.  Point is, the documentation will take a long time to make and maybe I'll get to it.  I'm planning on revisiting and refactoring this project, so maybe I'll do it when that day comes.
